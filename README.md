# React Tutorial

This is the React comment box example from [the React tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## To use

There are several simple server implementations included. They all serve static files from `public/` and handle requests to `/api/comments` to fetch or add data. Start a server with one of the following:

### Node

```sh
npm install
node server.js
```

### Python

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py
```

### Ruby
```sh
ruby server.rb
```

### PHP
```sh
php server.php
```

### Go
```sh
go run server.go
```

### Perl

```sh
cpan Mojolicious
perl server.pl
```

And visit <http://localhost:3000/>. Try opening multiple tabs!

## Changing the port

You can change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above, e.g.,

```sh
PORT=3001 node server.js
```

New React Developer Tools
September 2, 2015 by Ben Alpert

A month ago, we posted a beta of the new React developer tools. Today, we're releasing the first stable version of the new devtools. We're calling it version 0.14, but it's a full rewrite so we think of it more like a 2.0 release.
